            <strong>Coco's Enigmatic Algorithm</strong><br>
            Coco the Computer Scientist has discovered a fascinating, yet perplexing algorithm on an ancient scroll. The algorithm is powerful but incomplete, and Coco needs your assistance to decipher its functionality.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>The Algorithm's Steps:</strong><br>
            1. Begin with an integer n (where ( 1 &le; n &le; 100 ).<br>
            2. If n is odd, multiply it by a mysterious number x.<br>
            3. If n is even, divide it by 2.<br>
            4. Repeat steps 2-3 until n becomes 1.<br>
            <br>
            Hereâ€™s where the enigma deepens: The scroll indicates that regardless of the initial value of n, it will always reduce to 1 after a finite number of steps. Fascinatingly, each different n results in a unique sequence of numbers before reaching 1.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Coco's Challenge:</strong><br>
            - Find the mystical number x that makes the algorithm work for all integers n within the specified range.<br>
            <br>
            <em>Hint for the Challenge:</em><br>
            Observe the behavior of the sequence with different n values. Are there any mathematical patterns or famous conjectures that resemble Coco's Enigmatic Algorithm?
